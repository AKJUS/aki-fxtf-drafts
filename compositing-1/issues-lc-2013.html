<p>This document is the disposition of comments on the Compositing and Blending 
CR sent to the www-style, public-fx and www-svg mailing lists. The Compositing and Blending CR was 
published <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-css3-mediaqueries-20020708/">10 October 2013</a>.

<p>The following color coding convention is used for comments:</p>

<p>we've exposed
a pretty good example of why it's both tricky to implement and can produce unexpected
results (especially in today's compositors).

From what you describe this is exactly the behavior that we agreed on to the last two F2F meetings. The behavior that you describe as "parent layer" is described as isolation to the next stacking context. I would not say that this is confusing. It is something that you can experience with isolation in other graphic applications as well. In future levels we get a new property value for 'isolation' that allows authors to blend with the whole backdrop, but first browsers need to catch up.

<tr><td>2<td>
<p>I've been seeing this effect use more lately. Designers have to create it
manually or emulate it with CSS filters and careful overlapping of
elements. Maybe it's time to make it a simple CSS property like you propose.

All cases I've seen so far, apply the background blur over a rectangular
region. Earlier in the thread, I suggested that the effect should only
apply to the shape/coverage area but maybe that makes it too hard to
implement.

<p>
This is a feature request for level 2 of blending and compositing or filters.

<p>I am a bit confused when reading the spec. As I read it, the whole
discussion of Porter Duff Compositing Operators is irrelevant for SVG,
only applying to Canvas. Is this correct? The Abstract would lead one to
think otherwise.
<p>

<td>
<p>
This is a request for a non-normative change. This will be done during the CR process.

<tr><td>4<td>
<p>the test plan includes tests in SVG and
HTML, but compositing for SVG and HTML is deferred to level 2?
<p>

<td>
<p>
The only 'compositing' part that the spec currently defines, is for Canvas
2D. Compositing was stripped from the CSS properties because it required
major changes in the way browsers draw.
It will be back for level 2 and either we will change the model so it can
be implemented or we convince the browsers to redo their graphics engines.
