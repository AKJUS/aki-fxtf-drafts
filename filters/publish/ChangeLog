- renamed files, removing "SVG"
- temporarily commenting out reqs and primer publication
- update the intro section to be more language neutral, and
  generally replace SVG with XML for now.
- define the filter property in terms of a list of function
- describe the functions as a space separated list
  of commands like url(), sepia() etc.
- show the equivalent XML version for each shorthand function
