<!--
* security model on resource referencing (Dirk Schulze) - Added security model to specification. SVG resource fetching model will be defined by SVG Integration spec
* layered masking (Dirk Schulze) - defered; to be discussed together with supporting compositing models
* element selector (Brian Birtles) - different proposals to select elements in the CSS WG (GCPM, CSS UI). Defered until we resolved on a common solution.
* focus ring (Dirk Schulze) -

<tr><th colspan=3 class=source><a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webappsec/2013Apr/0006.html">Move security model to CSP</a> - Comment from Dirk Schulze on Thu, 4 Apr 2013; <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css-masking-1/#security">solution: fixed in the spec</a>.

<tr><td class="r">1<td>
<p>"CSS Masking and Filter Effects describe a security model for
loading filter/masking/clipping resources from different origins. Speaking
with some browser vendors it looks like these kind of security issues should
be handled by the Content Security Policy (CSP) spec."
</p>

<td>
<p>
A security model belongs to the specification. This security model was added and is part of CSS Masking Module Level 1. However, the SVG WG decided to work on a module called <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/svg2/raw-file/7a902f4a33f6/specs/integration/Overview.html">SVG Integration</a> which will define the fetching policies for SVG documents. Especially SVG documents loaded as source of further resources or as image.

<tr><th colspan=3 class=source><a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2013Sep/0884.html">Layered Masking</a> - Comment from Dirk Schulze on Sat, 31 Sep 2013.

<tr><td class="r">2<td>
<p>The prefixed implementation of CSS WebKit in Safari support multiple mask layers - similar to multiple background layers for the 'background-image' property. CSS Masking should support layers as well.
<p>


<td>
<p>
It was unclear how authors expect mask layers to interact with each other (union, intersection, ...). Another proposal is to composite different mask layers with each other and let the authors decide which compositing mode to use. Resolution from the CSS WG: defer layered masking to a future version of the spec. 
</p>




<tr><th colspan=3 class=source><a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-svg/2012Jul/0082.html">Reference elements by selectors</a> - Comment from Brian Birtles on Mon, 23 Jul 2012.

<tr><td class="r">3<td>
<p>Allow selecting mask and clipPath elements by CSS selectors in addition to fragment identifiers. Proposed: element(&lt;compound-selector>) function and child keyword.
<p>

<td>
<p>
The specifications CSS GCPM and CSS3 UI allow element selecting. The CSS WG is investigating to find a common solution that can be used by all specifications. Element selecting deferred to a future level of the specification by editor.
</p>



<tr><th colspan=3 class=source><a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2013Nov/0361.html">No effect of masking and clipping on focus ring</a> - Comment from Dirk Schulze on Wed, 20 Nov 2013.

<tr><td class="r">4<td>
<p>From the minutes: "<br>
 krit: I would like to discuss outline property.<br>
 krit: Right now the spec says that every painted thing gets filtered/<br>
       blended.<br>
 krit: Turns out that outline property is also used for focus rings,<br>
       and that is very important a11y. For this reason, it seems not<br>
       useful to have the focus ring be filtered etc.<br>
 krit: We should masking/filters/blending not affect the focus ring."
<p>

<td>
<p>
Resolution of CSS WG: Effects affect scrollbars and focus rings. We may work on controls later.
